## Requirements
- Get a list of urls of images from a remote place
- Parse the images url one by one, cache locally
- Resize the cached images to 600x600 such that they are centered (both horizontally and vertically) while maintaining aspect ratio and any extra space is covered with white padding.
- Images smaller shouldn't be resampled to 600x600, just push them in center of a 600x600 white background
- Cache resized images
- Display resized images on a page.


## Missing
- Testing
- Autoloading and Namespaces
